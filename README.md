# Todo-App

A feature-rich full-stack task and project management application inspired by tools like Todoist.

## Project Status

🚧 **Work in Progress**

- Frontend is largely complete
- Backend is under active development
- Core task, section, and project flows are being implemented

## Motivation

This project was built to practice real-world full-stack development and collaborative workflows.  
The focus is on building a functional, non-trivial product with a clean codebase that can be incrementally refined as the system evolves.

## Features (Current Scope)

- Projects containing multiple sections
- Tasks managed within sections and projects
- Nested subtasks (up to 5 levels deep)
- Task priority, description, and metadata
- List view and board (kanban-style) view
- Add, update, and remove tasks, sections, and projects

## Frontend Notes

- The frontend UI is custom-built
- No component libraries were used (except a date picker, its from material UI , that too is highlt customized)
- Layouts, styling, and interactions are implemented manually using CSS
- Focus was placed on recreating real product-level UX patterns

## Collaboration

This project is developed collaboratively as a shared learning effort, with frontend and backend responsibilities handled independently to simulate real-world team workflows.

## Local Setup

Setup instructions will be added once the backend reaches a stable state.
